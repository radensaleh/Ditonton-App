## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself.
It's recommended to do self-study about it before jumping into the project [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/).
And also on this project uses **Modularization** approach to separate each feature ([core](https://github.com/radensaleh/dicoding-flutter-expert/tree/final-submission/modules/core), [feature_about](https://github.com/radensaleh/dicoding-flutter-expert/tree/final-submission/modules/feature_about), [feature_movie](https://github.com/radensaleh/dicoding-flutter-expert/tree/final-submission/modules/feature_movie), [feature_tv](https://github.com/radensaleh/dicoding-flutter-expert/tree/final-submission/modules/feature_tv) modules).
